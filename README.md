# Tracer Pool Swaps

Project base generated with the Typescript Solidity Dev Starter Kit. See [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@rahulsethuram/the-new-solidity-dev-stack-buidler-ethers-waffle-typescript-tutorial-f07917de48ae) for more details
## Frontend Notes
### Calculating ABDKMathQuad values
The `PoolSwapLibrary` contains several methods for generating, converting, and using the raw ratio values. These can be used in the frontend to estimate the result of a transaction. It is vital when estimating the result of a transaction that the shadow pool amount for the commit type's opposite is included in the token total supply.

## Environment variables
The environment variables used in this project are documented in the `example.env` file at the root of the project. To configure, create a copy of `example.env`, rename to `.env`, and replace the placeholders with the correct values. 

## Using this Project

Install the dependencies with `npm install`. 
Build everything with `npm run build`. 

## Available Functionality

### Build Contracts and Generate Typechain Typeings
You'll need to run this before running tests if typescript throws an error about not finding the typechain artifacts.

`npm run compile`

### Run Contract Tests & Get Callstacks

In one terminal run `npx hardhat node`

Then in another run `npm run test`. 

Notes:
- You will need a valid api key for Alchemy api for the tests to succeed. This is due to the integration with chainlink - the test environment forks mainnet at block `12474747`.
- The gas usage table may be incomplete (the gas report currently needs to run with the `--network localhost` flag; see below).

### Run Contract Tests and Generate Gas Usage Report

In one terminal run `npx hardhat node`

Then in another run `npm run test -- --network localhost`

Notes:

- When running with this `localhost` option, you get a gas report but may not get good callstacks
- See [here](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter#installation-and-config) for how to configure the gas usage report.

### Run Slither for static analysis report
If you have `slither` installed and on your PATH, you can run `npm run slither` to get a report on the current codebase.

### Run Coverage Report for Tests

`npx hardhat coverage`

 
### Deploy to Ethereum

Create/modify network config in `hardhat.config.ts` and add API key and private key, then run:

`npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.ts`

### Verify on Etherscan

Using the [hardhat-etherscan plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html), add Etherscan API key to `hardhat.config.ts`, then run:

`npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby <DEPLOYED ADDRESS>`
